## Abstract


How should governments reduce spatial inequality: by attracting firms to disadvantaged regions or helping people reach thriving ones? Vietnam implemented both types of policies simultaneously through place-based tax incentives for firms in 2003 and the relaxation of the household registration system (Ho Khau) in 2005. I analyze these policies using a dynamic spatial general equilibrium model with firm life cycles and endogenous public services, and estimate key elasticities from policy-induced variations. The combined policies raise aggregate welfare by  1.3% and  reduce spatial inequality by 0.7%. 
Migration reform alone reduces spatial inequality three times more than tax incentives. 
However, the migration policy's impact depends critically on destination targeting: 
facilitating migration to the largest cities generates minimal redistribution, 
while reducing barriers to other destinations reduces spatial inequality by 1.3%, 
nearly double the combined policy effect.
These findings suggest that strategic policy design matters more than 
choosing between firm-based and people-based approaches.
