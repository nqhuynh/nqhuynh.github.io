In such a world, shall a government subsidize firms to enter or people to migrate out of poorer regions to increase welfare? What about a combination of them? I seek to answer these questions in the context of Vietnam. First, I document a pair of place-based and migration policies in the 2000s and show how they affect firms’ locations. I then leverage the time-varying aspect of the place-based policy to estimate a structural parameter of a dynamic model with forward-looking firms and households.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 17, 2022\n\n\nNghiem Q.

Using the 2001 US-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement as an exogenous shock, we investigate the link between Vietnam’s market access and the rise in sex ratio at birth. We test three hypotheses. First, the fall in tariffs increases regional wages and enables households with son preference to practice sex selection. Second, since the impact of the shock differs across industries with varied gender composition, it may alter the economic returns to gender, which pushes households’ decisions to sex-select. Finally, when this shock increases the labor market returns for mothers, they face a higher trade-off between work and children and thus sex-select more intensely to fulfill their son preference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 17, 2022\n\n\nNghiem Q.
