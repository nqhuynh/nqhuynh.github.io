#### [Place-based Policy, Migration Barriers, and Spatial Inequality](papers/Huynh_Nghiem_JMP.pdf){target="_blank"} \[JMP\]

## Abstract

Most low-income countries prioritize economic growth, but growth can increase inequality, especially regional disparities. This paper quantifies the effects of place-based incentives and easing migration barriers on spatial inequality in Vietnam. To this end, I develop a dynamic spatial general equilibrium model that captures interactions between policies, occupational choices, migration, congestion, and agglomeration effects. Using firm and household data spanning two decades, combined with model-consistent difference-in-differences strategies, I identify key parameters governing policy effects: the firm entry elasticity and the changes in migration costs. I find that place-based tax incentives diminish spatial inequality when coupled with robust public services. Easing migration barriers to developed areas, while reducing inequality, also decreases welfare in these cities. Combining easing migration barriers to cities and tax incentives in underdeveloped regions is more effective at reducing spatial inequality.

#### [Why Does the Sex Ratio at Birth Rise? Evidence from Vietnam](papers/Sex_ratio_vn.pdf){target="_blank"}

(with Ngoc T. Nguyen)

## Abstract

This study connects Vietnam's elevated sex ratio at birth (SRB) to the 2001 US-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement. Our model incorporates three major factors that influence SRB: income, relative returns based on the child's sex, and fertility. The model presents twelve predictions, which are tested using large-scale repeated cross-sectional and panel surveys in a difference-in-difference design. The results indicate that mothers who experience larger tariff reductions tend to have a stronger preference for sons, work more, and desire fewer children. These findings suggest that fertility is the main driver of the elevated SRB. Overall, this paper highlights the interplay between cultural norms, maternal income, childcare, and fertility, revealing the unexpected demographic impact of trade policies.
