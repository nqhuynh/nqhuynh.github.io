### Moving Firms or Moving People? The Case of Vietnam \[JMP\] 

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Abstract

This paper examines the interplay between two prevalent development policies: incentivizing firms to invest in impoverished areas and encouraging migration out of these regions. To this end, I quantify the effects of such policy changes on welfare in Vietnam. During the 2000s, the Vietnamese government introduced tax breaks for firms in disadvantaged districts and relaxed the Ho Khau policy, which had previously limited internal mobility. To assess the impact of these policies, I construct and estimate a dynamic spatial general equilibrium model using firm and household data and policy changes from Vietnam.

### Why does Sex Ratio at Birth Rise?  Evidence from Vietnam
(with [Ngoc T. Nguyen](https://sites.google.com/view/jade-ngoc-nguyen/home?authuser=0))

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Abstract

We test three theories of the rise in sex ratio at birth and find evidence that the fertility mechanism explains the recent increase in Vietnam. Using the 2001 US-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement as an exogenous shock, we show that mothers exposed to larger tariff cuts are more likely to have boys, work more hours and less likely to give birth. These results hold up when we account for other competing mechanisms, including changes in fathers' exposure to the policy and daughters' economic returns in repeated cross-sectional and panel data. This paper highlights the trade-off between work and children for mothers, and the potential role of trade policy in heightening this trade-off, leading to lower fertility and higher sex-selection.
