### Place-based Policy, Migration Barriers, and Spatial Inequality \[JMP\]

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Abstract

This study quantifies the effects of two policies, the Ho Khau reform reducing migration barriers and place-based tax incentives, on addressing spatial inequality in Vietnam. I develop a dynamic spatial general equilibrium model incorporating workers' and entrepreneurs' choices. The model highlights the dual role of policies: tax incentives lure entrepreneurs, boosting local demand, while eased migration barriers can both offset and amplify these effects. I leverage two decades of Vietnamese firm and household data, using difference-in-differences designs to identify two key factors influencing policy effects, including the spatial firm entry elasticity and migration costs associated with the Ho Khau reform. I find that place-based incentives enhance welfare in disadvantaged areas but penalize wealthier ones. Reduced migration costs, through the Ho Khau reform, boost welfare across the board, particularly benefiting poorer regions. When implemented together, these policies reinforce each other, further reducing spatial inequality.

### [Why Does the Sex Ratio at Birth Rise? Evidence from Vietnam](papers/Sex_ratio_vn.pdf){target="_blank"}

(with Ngoc Nguyen)

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Abstract

This study connects Vietnam's elevated sex ratio at birth (SRB) to the 2001 US-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement. Our model incorporates three major factors that influence SRB: income, relative returns based on the child's sex, and fertility. The model presents twelve predictions, which are tested using large-scale repeated cross-sectional and panel surveys in a difference-in-difference design. The results indicate that mothers who experience larger tariff reductions tend to have a stronger preference for sons, work more, and desire fewer children. These findings suggest that fertility is the main driver of the elevated SRB. Overall, this paper highlights the interplay between cultural norms, maternal income, childcare, and fertility, revealing the unexpected demographic impact of trade policies.
