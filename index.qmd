I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics at the [University of Oklahoma](https://www.ou.edu/cas/economics).

I am interested in spatial and development economics. I study how large-scale policy changes such as tax incentives and migration policies affect overall welfare and economic equity. 

My papers are on my [research page](/research.qmd), and my CV is [here](Huynh_Nghiem_CV.pdf){target="_blank"}.

I completed my PhD in Economics at Yale University in 2024. 

I can be reached at [nqh@ou.edu]{style="color: #333; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 1px dotted #999;"}.
