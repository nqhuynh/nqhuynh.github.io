Hello! My name is Nghiêm Q. Huỳnh (pronounced /Nee-em Hwin/).

My research lies at the intersection of development economics, spatial economics, and international trade.

In 2024, I graduated with a PhD from Yale and joined the University of Oklahoma as an Assistant Professor.

Here is my [CV](Huynh_Nghiem_CV.pdf){target="_blank"}.
