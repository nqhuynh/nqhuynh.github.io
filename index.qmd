My name is Nghiêm Q. Huỳnh (*pronounced Nee-em Hwin*), and I am an Assistant Professor in the [Economics Department at the University of Oklahoma](https://www.ou.edu/cas/economics). 

My research focuses on urban economics,  international trade, and development economics, with an emphasis on understanding how policies affect inequality and economic development.

I received my PhD in Economics from Yale University in May 2024.  

Here’s my [CV](Huynh_Nghiem_CV.pdf){target="_blank"}.
