    "section": "",
    "text": "We study how trade liberalization affects sex selection in a son-preferring society. Using the Vietnam–US 2001 trade agreement as a natural experiment, we exploit industry-level tariff cuts in a difference-in-differences framework. We find that women in exposed industries are more likely to have male children, work more, and have fewer births—effects driven solely by maternal, not paternal, exposure. A quantity-quality model with maternal time costs explains these patterns. Our findings reveal that rising maternal opportunity costs, rather than income or relative returns effects, can increase sex selection during economic transitions.\n\nPDF\nSSRN"

I construct a dynamic spatial general equilibrium model incorporating firm dynamics, occupational choices, migration, congestion, and agglomeration. Leveraging policy variations and model-consistent equations, I identify firm entry elasticity and changes in migration costs. The place-based policy increases economic activity and welfare in targeted areas despite compromising public services. The household registration reform has a small impact on spatial welfare inequality. Combining migration cost reductions to central provinces with tax incentives to disadvantaged ones mitigates welfare losses and reduces spatial inequality more effectively than each policy alone.\n\nPDF"
