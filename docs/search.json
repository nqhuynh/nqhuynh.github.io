    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited mobility of goods and people contributes to persistent inequality within and between countries. To address spatial inequality, two common policies are promoting business development in disadvantaged regions and reducing barriers to migration. I evaluate these policies in Vietnam where the government provided tax incentives for firms entering underdeveloped areas and eased the Ho Khau policy that restricted internal migration. To quantify their welfare effects, I develop a dynamic model that allows workers and entrepreneurs to sort across space and exploit policy variations to estimate key parameters through multiple difference-in-differences. The results reveal that tax incentives raise welfare in disadvantaged areas but come at a cost to richer ones. However, with greater worker mobility, place-based incentives can raise aggregate welfare and further reduce inequality. These findings highlight the importance of considering both worker mobility barriers and firm dynamics when evaluating the effects of place-based policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(with Ngoc Nguyen)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nThis study connects Vietnam’s elevated sex ratio at birth (SRB) to the 2001 US-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement. Our model incorporates three major factors that influence SRB: income, relative returns based on the child’s sex, and fertility. The model presents twelve predictions, which are tested using large-scale repeated cross-sectional and panel surveys in a difference-in-difference design. The results indicate that mothers who experience larger tariff reductions tend to have a stronger preference for sons, work more, and desire fewer children. These findings suggest that fertility is the main driver of the elevated SRB. Overall, this paper highlights the interplay between cultural norms, maternal income, childcare, and fertility, revealing the unexpected demographic impact of trade policies.\nSSRN"
