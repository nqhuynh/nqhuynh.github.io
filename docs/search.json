Shall a government subsidize firms to enter or people to migrate out of poorer regions to increase welfare? What about a combination of them? I seek to answer these questions in the context of Vietnam. First, I document a pair of place-based and migration policies in the 2000s and show how they affect firms’ locations. I then leverage the time-varying aspect of the place-based policy to estimate a structural parameter of a dynamic model with forward-looking firms and households.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 27, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSex Ratio: Evidence from Vietnam\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 17, 2022\n\n\nw/ Ngoc T.
